# NewsNet-Knowledge-Graph-via-LLM
The aim of this project is to develop a system capable of transforming unstructured text into a structured knowledge graph representation. This system will harness the capabilities of Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE), empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs). Through the systematic processing of raw data extracted from sources such as news articles and the utilization of advanced AI techniques, the system will identify, classify, and link entities, ultimately constructing a comprehensive knowledge graph.
